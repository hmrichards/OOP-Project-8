# OOP-Project-8: Dancing Crabs
This program contains a Crab class that can be used to construct a crab. 
Within the class there are four methods that can be used to customize the crab.
The first one is Dance which can be used to make the crab do one of three for a defined amount of time.
The second one is randomColor which can make the crab a random rainbow color. It can also make the body rainbow for 30 seconds. 
The third is dressUp which allows the user to put a bowtie, top hat, monocle, or hairbow onto the crab.
The last one is muscleCrab which allows the user to decide whether they want their crab lightweight, middleweight, or heavyweight.
The program was created for intro to object oriented programming spring 2020.

## Usage
crab.py uses the cs1graphics.py program which was created by professors at Saint Louis University.
